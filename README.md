# Spotify EDA Project

This repository contains an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project** focused on analyzing Spotify track popularity. The goal is to understand how different audio and descriptive features relate to track popularity, and to identify features most predictive of high popularity. Different multivariate and univariate analysis techniques are used to perform the analysis, and this is conducted using Python in Jupyter Notebook - using libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.


## Files

- **`Spotify EDA Project.ipynb`**  
  Jupyter Notebook containing the full EDA workflow, including data loading, cleaning, descriptive statistics, visualizations, correlation analysis, and multivariate exploration.

- **`high_popularity_spotify_data.csv`**  
  Dataset containing Spotify tracks with high popularity scores. Used for comparative analysis in the notebook.

- **`low_popularity_spotify_data.csv`**  
  Dataset containing Spotify tracks with low popularity scores. Used for comparative analysis in the notebook.

> **Important:** All files must be in the **same directory** when running the notebook, as the code assumes the datasets are located alongside the notebook. If cloning to your own machine, make sure that you preserve the same file structure or the code will not execute.

## Objectives

- Explore Spotify track features to understand patterns related to track popularity.
- Identify key audio and playlist features that influence popularity trends.
